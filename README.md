# Ibrahim-EX4-B

This repository is for a Space shooter game in unity, it's for the first part of exericse 4 in the game development course.

I implemented two tasks in the homework pdf:
1. The player has the ability to get a sheild by colliding with the green + in the screen, if the player does so, then he gets a sheild for 5 seconds.
2. The player has three lives (hit points) meaning he can get hit three times without dying
